# Introduction

Vue3 Apollo is a composable-first integration between Vue 3 and Apollo Client v4.
It provides typed, reactive GraphQL primitives with minimal setup for Vue and Nuxt 4 apps.

I created it because, for some production projects, I needed a faster and more up-to-date option while official Vue Apollo integrations were optimizing for a different release cadence.

## Who it's for

- Teams building Vue 3 or Nuxt 4 apps with GraphQL
- Projects migrating from `@vue/apollo-composable`
- Apps that need both reactive composables and imperative Apollo client access

## Key Features

- Seamless integration with Vue 3’s Composition API
- Full TypeScript support
- Reactive queries with automatic cache updates
- Easy configuration for multiple Apollo clients
- SSR and Nuxt compatibility
