# Credits

This project was developed from practical Apollo GraphQL usage across real-world Vue projects.
The goal was to provide a faster, modern alternative aligned with Apollo Client v4 and current Vue 3 workflows.

## Personal note

After working with GraphQL in production, I wanted a composable-first package with a smaller surface area, predictable behavior, and up-to-date Apollo support for Vue and Nuxt.
