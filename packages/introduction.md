# Introduction

Vue3 Apollo is a lightweight, modern integration between Vue 3 and Apollo Client v4.  
It provides the latest Apollo features with full TypeScript support and a composable-first API for seamless GraphQL development.  

After years of using Apollo GraphQL across my projects, I wanted a faster and more up-to-date alternative to the official Vue Apollo packages, which often lag behind Apollo Client releases.  
Vue3 Apollo is built from the ground up for simplicity, reactivity, and compatibility with modern Vue 3 workflows.  

This project was developed with the help of modern AI tools — **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, and **Junie** (JetBrains AI Coding Agent) — which supported code generation, refactoring, and documentation.

## Key Features

- Seamless integration with Vue 3’s Composition API  
- Full TypeScript support  
- Reactive queries with automatic cache updates  
- Easy configuration for multiple Apollo clients  
- SSR and Nuxt compatibility
